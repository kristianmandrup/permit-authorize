# Permit Authorizer

Authorization via Permits for Javascript.

This library has been developed for *Node.js* but can be used on any platform which supports either
the [CommonJS[(http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS) or [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) module system.

 ## Design and Architecture

See [wiki](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/permit-authorize/wiki) for an overview.

Most important sections:

* [Permits](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/permit-authorize/wiki/Permits)
* [Rules](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/permit-authorize/wiki/Rules)

This project was extracted from [authorize-mw](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/authorize-mw) to provide a self contained authorization
solution. The authorize-mw project is part of a general purpose middleware stack.

## Code

The code has been developed in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/) which is very similar too [Coffee script](http://coffeescript.org/).
See [coffee-to-ls](http://livescript.net/#coffee-to-ls)

## Installation

The main file is `index.js` which exposes the following:

```
Authorizer :   requires.lib 'authorizer'
Ability :      requires.lib 'ability'
Allower :      requires.lib 'allower'
Permit :       requires.lib 'permit'
permit-for:    requires.permit 'permit-for'
```

To use this library...

```javascript
authorize = require('permit-authorize');
```

Then require what you need as demonstrated in the usage examples below.

```javascript
Permit      = authorize.Permit;
permit-for  = authorize.permit-for;
```

`permit-for` is a factory method to create permits. The other keys all point to constructor functions in the form of LiveScript "classes".

## Browser usage

Try [browserify](http://browserify.org)

`browserify index.js -o permit-authorize.js`

## Usage examples

The following is a complete example, using LiveScript syntax for a clearer picture.

```LiveScript
lo = require 'lodash'

authorize = require 'permit-authorize'

Permit      = authorize.Permit
permit-for  = authorize.permit-for

class Book extends Base
  (obj) ->
    super ...

book = new Book title: title

class GuestUser extends User
  (obj) ->
    super ...

  role: 'guest'

guest-user   = new GuestUser name: 'unknown'

guest-permit = permit-for('guest',
  match: (access) ->
    @matches(access).user role: 'guest'

  rules:
    ctx:
      area:
        guest: ->
          @ucan 'publish', 'Paper'
        admin: ->
          @ucannot 'publish', 'Paper'

    read: ->
      @ucan 'read' 'Book'
    write: ->
      @ucan 'write' 'Book'
    default: ->
      @ucan 'read' 'any'
)

Ability     = authorize.Ability

user = (name) ->
  new User name

book = (title) ->
  new Book title

ability = (user) ->
  new Ability user

a-book = book 'some book'
current-user = user 'kris'

current-ability = ability(current-user)

user-can = (access-request) ->
  current-ability.can access-request

if user-can action: 'read', subject: a-book
  # code to read the book
```

The same example in Javascript (see *usage-examples* folder):

First we include the main authorize modules to be used

```javascript

var lo, authorize, Permit, permitFor, Ability,
    Book, book,
    GuestUser, guestUser,
    GuestPermit, guestPermit,
    user, ability, aBook, currentUser, currentAbility,
    userCan, readBook;

lo = require('lodash');

authorize = require('permit-authorize');

Ability = authorize.Ability;
Permit = authorize.Permit;
permitFor = authorize.permitFor;
```

Then we set up some user models:

```
User = require(./models/user');

GuestUser = function(properties){
  // User prototypical inheritance?
  // guest user constructor code...
}
// all guest users have a role of guest
GuestUser.prototype.role = 'guest';

guestUser = new GuestUser({
  name: 'a guest'
});
```

We define a permit to use for authorization

```
GuestPermit = new Permit('guest');

// The GuestPermit only applies if the access request contains a user with role = 'guest'
GuestPermit.prototype.

guestPermit = permitFor('guest', {
  // Determine when the permit applies
  match: function(access){
      return this.matches(access).user({
        role: 'guest'
  },
  // authorization rules to apply when permit applies
  rules: {
    // context dependent rules (dynamic)
    ctx: {
      area: {
        guest: function(){
          return this.ucan('publish', 'Paper');
        },
        admin: function(){
          return this.ucannot('publish', 'Paper');
        }
      }
    },
    // action rules (dynamic)
    read: function(){
      return this.ucan('read', 'Book');
    },
    write: function(){
      return this.ucan('write', 'Book');
    },
    // default rule always applies for any user, action, subject or context
    // static rules
    'default': function(){
      return this.ucan('read', 'any');
    }
  }
});

// utility functions and constructors...
user = function(name){
  return new User(name);
};

Book = function(properties){
  // book constructor code...
}

book = function(title){
  return new Book(title);
};

ability = function(user){
  return new Ability(user);
};

userCan = function(accessRequest){
  return currentAbility.can(accessRequest);
};

userCannot = function(accessRequest){
  return currentAbility.cannot(accessRequest);
};


readBook = function(user, book){
  // code for user to read the book
};


aBook           = book('some book');
currentUser     = user('kris');
currentAbility  = ability(currentUser);

// Finally, here we go :)

if (userCan({action: 'read', subject: aBook})) {
  readBook(currentUser, aBook);
}

if (userCannot({action: 'read', subject: 'Book'})) {
  throw new Error("Stupid illiterate user!");
}
```

## Current status

All tests are passing :)

Note to self: *rule-applier* needs more tests...

To facilitate testing, each class implements `Debugger` which allows using `debug-on!` on the class or instance level to track
 what goes on inside.

Use `xdescribe`, `describe.skip` and `describe.only` to select which tests to execute.

### Caching

A caching strategy has been implemented as `CachedAbility`.

When using a `CachedAbility`, a cached authorization result for an `AccessRequest` will be retrieved
from the cache and returned if present. If not found, a result will be generated and cached.
The caching solution uses a fingerprint of the `AccessRequest` to determine the cache key.

*Fingerprinting*

For each of the elements making up the `AccessRequest` to get the "fingerprint":
- Object: `hash` function is attempted called defaulting to JSON stringify if not present.
- String: value is fingerprint
- Array: values combined with '.'

Each of these fingerprints are concatenated into one fingerprint to be used as the cache key.
If an `AccessRequest` with the same fingerprint (hash) is evaluated again later, the cached authorization result is fetched
immediately for much better performance!

Please not that it is highly recommended to add a `hash` method to your `User` and subject models in order for the fingerprinting to work
correctly and efficiently.

### Performance using CachedAbility

The result can be seen by running *cached_ability_test.js*

```LiveScript
for i from 1 to 10
  ability.guest.not-allowed-for(action: 'write', subject: book).should.be.true
```

`guest ability: uncached: 123ms` vs `guest ability: cached: 2ms`

Pretty cool :)

## Design

*Why LiveScript?*

Since it is faster/easier to develop the basic functionality. Should be easy later refactor the code to use another approach.

*Why classes and not prototypical inheritance?*

See reasoning for Livescript. Was simply easier/faster to implement using classes.

Feel free to fork this project and provide a version without classes if that is a MUST for you...

## Testing

Run `mocha` on all files in test folder

Just run all test like this:

`$ mocha`

To execute individual test, do like this:

`$ mocha test/authorize-mw/permit_test.js`

### Test coverage

The library [istanbul](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/12/javascript-code-coverage-with-istanbul.html) is used for code coverage.

See [code-coverage-with-mocha](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16633246/code-coverage-with-mocha) for use with mocha.

```
npm install -g istanbul
istanbul cover _mocha -- -R spec
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

`$ istanbul cover _mocha`

 To measure coverage of individual test:

 `$ istanbul cover _mocha test/authorize-mw/permit_test.js`
